cmake + compile on windows:
- #define GLFW_DLL?
	-> automatically defined by cmake glfw imported target ?
		(INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS) ?
- require version 3.3 for GLFW?
- GLEW: checking for extensions (check if anisotropic filtering is 
	actually available before using it)
- what is the correct way to deal with resource files?
	-> copy or link them from the source-directory into the 
		build directory? (and how to do that?)
	-> how to tell cmake that Qt-Creator should show the shader files
		in the outliner?
	-> how to figure out which of the resource files are actually used/needed 
		to build/run the application?
		(e.g. the gimp *.xcf-files are not used directly while building and
		 running the application, only the manually exported *.png-files are)


important:
- how should VertexAttributeLayout::setLocations(..) prevent attributes of nonexistent shader 
	variables to take the same location as attributes of actually existing shader variables

Camera:
- remove unnecessary inversion of z-coordinate in obj-import code?

imgui:
- correctly handle keyboard events between my code and imgui:
	-> glfwPollEvents() in the beginning of the main loop already as in the imgui example?
	"Note: Those flags are updated by ImGui::NewFrame(). 
	However it is generally more correct and easier that you poll flags from the previous frame, then submit your inputs, then call NewFrame(). 
	If you attempt to do the opposite (which is generally harder) you are likely going to submit your inputs after NewFrame(), and therefore too late."
		https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#q-how-can-i-tell-whether-to-dispatch-mousekeyboard-to-dear-imgui-or-to-my-application
	-> check io.WantCaptureMouse, io.WantCaptureKeyboard and io.WantTextInput ?

Blending:
- add a Demo that tries the different example blending settings mentioned in the OpenGL-wiki
	e.g.: traditional alpha blending:
		glBlendEquationSeparate(GL_FUNC_ADD, GL_FUNC_ADD);
		glBlendFuncSeparate(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE, GL_ZERO);

GLFW:
- also install glfw3-wayland?
- glfw version 3.2.1 too old? (website recommends >= 3.3.2)
	-> compile GLFW from source instead?
- static vs. dynamic linking against glfw and glew. which is better?
	-> and why does pkg-config --libs --static not include -Wl,-Bstatic -Wl,-Bdynamic ?
- #define GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE ?
- glfw-timer vs. c++-stdlib timer?


c++:
- gl_type_id.h 
	template<typename C, std::size_t N>
		constexpr std::optional<VertexAttribType> gl_type_to_id<std::array<C, N>> = ...
	-> is partial template specialization allowed for variable templates
		-> this says yes: https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/08/11/how-to-do-partial-template-specialization-in-c/
	-> does partial template specialization allow specializing template parameters in terms of new
		template parameters (e.g. T=std::array<C, N> defines T but introduces new parameters C and N)
	-> is this a partial template specialization or some kind of overload

c++-stdlib:
- use ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) to improve performance?
- std::optional<...>
	-> generally use std::optional<..> everywhere where there is a boolean that keeps track of 
		whether another variable is valid 
		(maybe also where there is a pointer where nullptr represents an invalid value?)

cpu_mesh_utils:
- in addIndexBuffer(..) use gsl::span from Guidelines Support Library instead of std::vector for
	the current vertex and for the key_type in the array in order to avoid unnecessary copy operations
	-> problem span does not have comparison operations
		-> define custom < operation for the map
		-> use std::equal(..) instead of == to compare the current vertex with the restartVertex


OpenGL:
- GLCall(...) macro is fragile
	-> e.g. 
		if (...)
			GLCall(x());
		if (...)
			GLClearError();
			x();
			myAssert(GLLocCall(...))
		-> x() is not part of the if's body anymore!!
- std::array 
	-> is std::array guaranteed to allow copy construction of new arrays?
		-> also if array to be copied from is a line of a 2D-array?
	-> and is it guaranteed to have the same memory layout as a normal C-style array?

GLTexture:
- do GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER and GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_* really have no
	default value according to the OpenGL specification? And is the implementation really
	allow to draw a black texture when not explicitly setting those? (as claimed by cherno)
- implement copy/move-constructor/assignment

GLShaderProgram:
- also cache vertex attribute locations (similar to the uniform locations)
	-> how to avoid making getAttribLocation(...) non-const?


VertexBufferLayout:
- add templated versions of the other overloads of append(..) as well
	-> maybe add helper-function/variable-template/whatever that converts
		OpenGL types to their corresponding GLenum constant
		(How does this work?)


abstraction into classes me vs. cherno:
- generally:
	-> cherno: debug utils are in same header as class Renderer
	-> cherno: Bind() and Unbind() are const
- ShaderProgram
	-> cherno: ShaderProgram only called Shader
	-> me: separate classes for Shader and ShaderProgram
	-> cherno: also contains parsing function and directly accepts filename in constructor	
	-> cherno: it is not possible to create a Shader without immediately compiling/linking it in the constructor already



abstracting into classes other TODOs:
- ShaderProgram should not link before compiling and co.


removed differences me vs. cherno:
- generally
	-> cherno: member variables are prefixed with m_
	-> cherno: ids of OpenGL-Objects are called m_RendererID
- Buffers
	- cherno: VertexBuffer and IndexBuffer are separate classes
- BufferLayout
	-> append takes componentType as template argument rather than as regular function argument
	-> cherno: there is an actual class for the BufferLayout which contains VertexBufferElements
	-> me: there is only a std::vector of VertexAttributeType (=VertexBufferElement)
- GLMesh + VAO
	-> cherno: there is no GLMesh class that takes care of vao, BufferLayout and vbo simultanously
	-> cherno: but the vao-class itself also takes a BufferLayout and a reference to the vbo
	-> cherno: vao-class still does not take a reference to an ibo
	-> cherno: vao-class still does not create vbo by itself it merely takes it as a function 
		argument to function AddBuffer(...)
- ShaderProgram:
	-> cherno: glUseProgram(..) is called Bind()
- Renderer
	-> me: separate renderer class does not exist: glDrawElements(...) is called from main(..) function directly


DONE GLFW:
- set an error callback
- glfwDestroyWindow(...) in the end (but before glfwTerminate() )
- retrieve framebuffer-size and call glViewport(...)
	-> also set a callback to be notified if the size of the window changes

DONE CAMERA:
- signedness of yaw pitch roll?
- for better performance do not use generic inverse() in mat_cc_from_wc()
	(but maybe still use inverse() in debug mode as a comparison?)


DONE:
- which of those functions do I need to call again for every frame when rendering multiple
	3D-models (each from its own buffer)
	- glBindBuffer(...) ?
	- glEnableVertexAttribArray(...) ?
	- glVertexAttribPointer(...) ?
	-> and is the situation different when using glDrawArray(...) (no index buffer)
		vs. when using glDrawElements(...) (with index buffer)
	-> answer depends on whether we use Vertex Array Objects
		see video 12 Vertex Arrays in OpenGL
- clean up vertex buffers and co. at the end of the program
	-> destructors take care of that
- in assignment operator do delete previous content if there is any!!
- after reading chapters 9 + 10 in stroustrup look again at function ParseShader(...)
- rename getName to getRendererID()
- compile with gcc specific macro  -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG_PEDANTIC
	-> and what do those do?: -D_GLIBCXX_CONCEPT_CHECKS 
		-> I don't know I added a comment line to the makefile to remind me
			I might consider looking this up and maybe use it
	-> what happens if I compile with -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG but link against a library
		that was compiled without -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG?
		-> from my experiment (with *.o files instead of libraries) it seems to give a linker error
- use path instead of string?
	-> e.g. for platform independent filename separator ( '/' vs '\' )
		(I hope that passing path::format::generic_format to the path constructor will take
		 care of that)
- std::optional<...>
	-> in parseShader() use std::optional<GLenum> instead of std::variant<std::monostate, GLenum> to store the shader type
	-> use std::optional<...> for CPUIndexBuffer::primitiveRestartIndex
		and remove boolean primitiveRestart
		(same for CPUMultiIndexBuffer and for GLIndexBuffer)
	-> use std::optional<std::vector<GLbyte>> for parameter restartVertex
		in addIndexBuffer()
