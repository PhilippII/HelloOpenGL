GLFW:
- also install glfw3-wayland?
- glfw version 3.2.1 too old? (website recommends >= 3.3.2)
	-> compile GLFW from source instead?
- static vs. dynamic linking against glfw and glew. which is better?
	-> and why does pkg-config --libs --static not include -Wl,-Bstatic -Wl,-Bdynamic ?
- which of those functions do I need to call again for every frame when rendering multiple
	3D-models (each from its own buffer)
	- glBindBuffer(...) ?
	- glEnableVertexAttribArray(...) ?
	- glVertexAttribPointer(...) ?
- clean up vertex buffers and co. at the end of the program
- after reading chapters 9 + 10 in stroustrup look again at function ParseShader(...)
